### Disclaimers

If the "yaoi" in URL didn't tip you off, I am a shipper. I've wanted to make this timeline since Melting Point **as a personal reference for writing canon-compliant fanfiction.** Hence, a text-based reference free from the terrors of Twitter search. My own opinions and analyses are included throughout, as the point of these posts is to help me keep my—not necessarily *their*—narrative straight.

One of the fun parts of shipping real people, to me, is that we can all look at the same moments between the same people and come to completely different conclusions. By no means do I see this chronicle as an absolute truth, nor should you read it as one. This timeline is not proof or evidence or whatever else that Matthew and Gunwook are exploring each others' bodies in the biblical sense. It is one guy's attempt to frame a series of scenes as a story with romantic undercurrents.

If you want to see their moments without commentary, I highly recommend watching [@withmattparkz](https://www.youtube.com/@withmattparkz)'s compilation videos. I do hope that people are still able to learn about mattparkz moments they may have missed or glean some crumb of entertainment value from this series, even if your interpretation ultimately differs from mine.
